# FlightFinder-Navigating-Your-Air-Travel-Options
The Flight Booking App is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to demonstrate the core concepts of modern web development. Built with React.js on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend, it uses MongoDB as the primary database to store flight and booking information. This app allows users to browse and search for flights, view available routes, and make flight reservations through a clean and responsive user interface. It includes essential features such as dynamic flight listings, user-friendly forms, and real-time communication between the client and server using RESTful APIs. The backend ensures secure and structured data handling, while MongoDB provides flexibility for storing flight data in a scalable, document-based format. This project is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand the structure and flow of a real-world web application, from setting up the frontend and backend to connecting to a database and deploying the final product. The goal of this app is both educational and practical â€” to help developers understand how different technologies in the JavaScript ecosystem work together to build a functional, interactive platform.
